    <h2>Games industry experience</h2>
    <p>I have been employed in the games industry continuously since January 2021. I specialise in Unity, having used it in a hobbyist or professional manner since 2013.</p>
    <ul>

        <li><b>Where and when: </b>Maze Theory - Jul 23 - Dec 25 (2.5 years)</li>
        <li><b>Key responsibilities: </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Team makeup: 1 principal gameplay programmer, 1 mid level programmer, 1 junior programmer, 1 technical artist. Support later in the project from contractors when needed (max team size was 8).</li>
            <li><b>Code lead representing the team</b>, representing and decision making in feature meetings.<b>Subject matter expert for all things code</b> often pushing back on scope creep and an advocate for maintaining performance and stability as much as possible.</li>
            <li><b>Responsible for code quality.</b> Set up our branching strategy (Git) for multi-platform synchronous development and <b>oversaw pull request reviews on Github</b>. <b>Developed a post-release strategy for patching</b> to speed up patch frequency.</li>
            <li><b>Built and architected a significant number of key features:</b> enemy AI, menu systems, pause handling, checkpoint and save/ load system for quick level reloading (as well as between session save/ load).</li>
            <li><b>Maintained our CI pipeline in Github Actions.</b> Originally built by a contractor I ensure its continued usefulness, <b>adding automated upload support for Quest and Steam and general versatility, such as specifying speciic Unity versions.</b></li>
            <li><b>Implemented large performance gains in the final weeks to ensure we could ship the game.</b> One of a few solutions was to place a number of triggers in "the sky" to get around slowdown from the physics system, saving nearly 6ms on PS5.</li>
            <li><b>Became release manager for our three platforms,</b> a consequence of that role being made redundant elsewhere in the organisation. Handled build uploads and versioning (especially for PS5 after master release), and user management for beta builds.</li>
            <li><b>Mentored and line managed three developers (one tech artist).</b> Alongside general day-to-day support I helped to build a career matrix to aid in career/ promotion conversations. Had some difficult conversations where some individual performances were lacking, but also saw great growth in two reports who certainly deserved promotions during their time on the project.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Role: </b>Developer/ producer</li>
        <li><b>Platforms: </b>Steam</li>
        <li><b>Where and when: </b>Curveball Games - March 18 to Dec 18 (10 months)</li>
        <li><b>Key responsibilities: </b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Developed my own game for the Steam store.</b> Island Invasion was a tower defense game with procedurally generated maps and unlimited waves of enemies.</li>
            <li>The player can build on land or sea, depending on building type. They must manage their cashflow with rewards from enemies as well as mining oil, which they can then purchase new towers with or upgrade existing towers.</li>
            <li>Multiple tower types: mortar (splash damage), gun, laser (more damage the longer it's on an enemy), temporal (slows enemies down), flak (splash airborne damage), and missile (land or air homing missiles).</li>
            <li>Towers can target first, last, strong or weak enemies, a QoL improvement that I had positive feedback on.</li>
            <li><b>Implemented leaderboards and achievements with Steamworks.</b></li>
            <li><b>Wrote all code, developed 3D assets, and managed release of the game to Steam.</b></li>
            <li><b>Worked with two contractors,</b> a 2D artist and a composer, who supported on areas I'm not skilled at.</li>
            <li>Removed from Steam as it wasn't worth keeping up due to the £100 HMRC bill every year!</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Non-games experience</h2>
    <p>Professionally I have been a software engineer for over <span id="employed_length"></span> years. In that time I have worked in a number of sectors outside of games,
    including cyber security, mobile casino development, and energy.</p>
    <p>The range of languages and technologies I've used over the years have granted me a quirky and unique set of skills, many of which contribute to my versatility as a games developer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Git</b> - used in all jobs since 2014. Often called upon to solve git woes, be it clearing out refs or solving merge conflicts.</li>
        <li><b>CI/CD</b> - managed the CI/CD environment at OVO Energy (CircleCI) and at Maze Theory (Github Actions). Confident in setting up simple ecosystems to boost productivity and build capability.</li>
        <li><b>Cloud development</b> - dabbled in Google Cloud Platform and AWS at OVO Energy and rolled out some microservices using TypeScript. By no means an expert but know my way around.</li>
        <li><b>Web development</b> - you wouldn't know it from this website, but I am competent in raw JS as well as TypeScript.</li>
        <li><b>Unix</b> - I've been continuously exposed to Linux systems since I started work in 2012. I know my way around a Unix shell.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Outside of work</h2>
    <p>I'm a keen golfer, always looking for an elusive GIR. I generally enjoy being outdoors on walks or runs. At home I relax with some crafts or a video game. I love a good board game with friends.</p>
    <p>When it comes to games I'm a Nintendo kid at heart and am a sucker for nostalgia. I also love a good sim or strategy game. I will happily enjoy a big hit like Subnautica or Hades too.</p>
    <p>My top video games (for a bit of fun/ controversy/ small talk):</p>
    <ol reversed>
        <li>Hollow Knight</li>
        <li>Spyro: Reignited Trilogy</li>
        <li>Theme Park World</li>
