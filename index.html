    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Games industry experience</h3>

    <h3>Non-games experience</h3>
    <p>Professionally I have been a software engineer for over <span id="employed_length"></span> years. In that time I have worked in a number of sectors outside of games,
    including cyber security, mobile casino development, and energy.</p>
    <p>The range of languages and technologies I've used over the years have granted me a quirky and unique set of skills, many of which contribute to my versatility as a games developer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Git</b> - used in all jobs since 2014. Often called upon to solve git woes, be it clearing out refs or solving merge conflicts.</li>
        <li><b>CI/CD</b> - managed the CI/CD environment at OVO Energy (CircleCI) and at Maze Theory (Github Actions). Confident in setting up simple ecosystems to boost productivity and build capability.</li>
        <li><b>Cloud development</b> - dabbled in GPC at OVO Energy and rolled out some microservices using TypeScript. By no means an expert but know my way around.</li>
        <li><b>Web development</b> - you wouldn't know it from this website, but I am competent in raw JS as well as TypeScript.</li>
        <li><b>Unix</b> - I've been continuously exposed to Linux systems since I started work in 2012. I know my way around a Unix shell.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Outside of work</h3>
    <p>I'm a keen golfer, always looking for an elusive GIR. I generally enjoy being outdoors on walks or runs. At home I relax with some crafts or a video game. I love a good board game with friends.</p>
    <p>All time top video games:</p>
    <ol reversed>
        <li>Hollow Knight</li>
        <li>Spyro: Reignited Trilogy</li>
        <li>Theme Park World</li>
